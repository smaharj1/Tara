# Tara 
#### *Finding your perfect gift*
Tara is an application that solves the problem of finding the best gift for your friends for various events like birthdays, weddings, or first date. This unique approach dismisses the tremendous headache to find the perfect gift. Moreover, Tara also helps to find out your friends' interests and activities that would take you anywhere from few days to few years manually. 

## So, how does it work?
Tara does exactly what we would do. It looks at your friend's facebook posts and analyzes the content to generate a personalized model with her interests. The difference between us and Tara is that Tara would do that in couple of seconds. Tara then analyzes the posts and finds out what your friend is most interested in. For example, S/he might be really into movies, particularly, freaky and spooky stuffs. Then, you know where to take her. *Hint: take her to the doctor*

## Challenges
1. Building a grammatically right model was a challenge as English is only our second and third language. So, teaching a computer to build a grammatical connection of words was quite an interesting challenge. 
2. Microsoft APIs were also a challenge. But we got over it! The list of APIs we used are below.
3. Since LAHacks didn't have good wifi. We had to end up doing everything in one computer. It was a challenge but Bishal and I also really got to connect as friends.

## Thankful to these APIs
1. Facebook Graph API
2. Microsoft Linguistic Analysis API
2. Microsoft SpellCheck API
3. Microsoft Sentiment Analysis API
4. Ultralingua API
5. StopWord API

## Platforms
1. **NodeJS**: The backend is entirely in ExpressJS. 
2. **HTML/CSS**: Just the basic stuffs that are used for frontend. We just made dummy front end in 2 hours.

## Potential
Really, sky is the limit regarding Tara's use. It can be made as broad as we want and as specific as we want. There are many platforms that gives great suggestions as to what YOU should buy. But there aren't much when it comes to finding someone else a gift. We would like to open it up to you DEVELOPERS to explore as this is all open source now!

## Thanks to LA Hacks to amazing opportunity!
